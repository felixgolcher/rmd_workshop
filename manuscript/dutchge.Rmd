**What shall we do?**

1. Open your `Rmd` file and fill in the YAML variables for the mock paper

2. Compile to `PDF`

3. Cycle through 1. and 2. until your `PDF` reproduces `r doc1` as closely as possible.
    - Use an author name of your liking.
    - Make sure to remove the table of contents.
    - Pay attention to the font size.
    - Make the date string dynamic. R hint:
```{r}
Sys.Date()
```
