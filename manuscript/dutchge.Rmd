**Abstract:**
This paper is about Dutch prefixes. 
It uses an example data set from (Baayen 2008).

# Introduction

We tried to figure out if the frequency of a word has an influence on the duration of Dutch prefixes. 
Intuitively one could assume that with the duration drops with frequency.
For this we recruited 130 Dutch native speakers.
They produced 421 different words.
Figure 1 gives an overview of the data. We clearly see a downward trajectory.

# Methods and Materials

We applied [methods](#methods) to [materials](#materials).

It can quite generally be said that $$a+b=b+a$$ where $a$ and $b$ are some real numbers.

**What shall we do?**

Update your `Rmd` file so the output matches `r doc3`.

* Update `YAML` header as well
* Activate automatic section numering in the `YAML` header.

If you don't remember the syntax, the cheatsheet or google will surely help. If not, I'm there to help.
