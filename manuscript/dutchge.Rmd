Abstract: 
This paper is about Dutch prefixes. 
It uses an example data set from (Baayen 2008).

We tried to figure out if the frequency of a word has an influence on the duration of Dutch suffixes. 
Intuitively one could assume that with the duration drops with frequency.
For this we recruited 130 Dutch native speakers.
They produced 421 different words.
Figure 1 gives an overview of the data. We clearly see a downward trajectory.

**What shall we do?**

It is generally no bad idea to put each sentence on a new line.
The output text does not show the line break.
That's why you are supposed to put a line break between sentences in this document as well.
