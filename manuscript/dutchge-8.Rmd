**Abstract:**
This paper is about Dutch prefixes. 
It uses an example data set from @Pluymaekers2005, cited by @baayen08 [126,338].

# Introduction

We tried to figure out if the frequency of a word has an influence on the duration of Dutch prefixes. 
Intuitively one could assume that with the duration drops with frequency.
For this we recruited **`r length(unique(durationsGe$Speaker))`** Dutch native speakers.
They produced **`r length(unique(durationsGe$Word))`** different words.
Figure 1 gives an overview of the data. We clearly see a downward trajectory.


```{r, include=F}
doc8 <- "this document"
```

# Methods and Materials

We applied [methods](#methods) to [materials](#materials).

It can quite generally be said that $$a+b=b+a$$ where $a$ and $b$ are some real numbers and $a+b$ is the sum of $a$ and $b$.

There are

1. things that are not dashes
4. things that are dashes
    - short dashes: -
        a. they are basically not dashes at all, but minus signs.
        z. This fact is rarely relevant.
    - longer dashes: --
    - really long dashes: ---

## Methods

They where great

Here are the [materials](#materials).

## Materials

Subjects were told what to do.

**What shall we do?**

Update your `Rmd` file so the output matches `r doc8`.

```{r, include=F}
sleep <- sleep[1:10,]
```

* add a setup chunk
  - set the default chunk options `echo`, `warning`, and `message` to `FALSE`
  - load the packages `tidyverse` and `stargazer`.
     - install them if they are not yet installed.
  - add the following line of code to load the data we need:
```{r, eval=F, echo=TRUE}
data("durationsGe", package = "languageR")
```
- Render the two bold faced numbers as inline code
  - hint: Example code
```{r, echo=TRUE}
a <- c(1,2,1)
length(unique(a)) # count different values in a vector
sleep$extra # access a column of a data frame
```

If you don't remember the syntax, the cheatsheet or google will surely help. If not, I'm there to help.
