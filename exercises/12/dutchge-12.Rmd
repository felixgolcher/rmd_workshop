**Abstract:**
This paper is about Dutch prefixes. 
It uses an example data set from @Pluymaekers2005, cited by @baayen08 [126,338].

# Introduction

```{r blub, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A very interesting graphical description of the data.", fig.width=5, fig.height=2.5}
ggplot(durationsGe,
       aes(Frequency, DurationOfPrefix))+
  geom_point()+
  scale_x_log10()+
  scale_y_log10()+
  geom_smooth(method=lm)+
  theme_bw()
```


We tried to figure out if the frequency of a word has an influence on the duration of Dutch prefixes. 
Intuitively one could assume that with the duration drops with frequency.
For this we recruited **`r length(unique(durationsGe$Speaker))`** Dutch native speakers.
They produced **`r length(unique(durationsGe$Word))`** different words.
Figure \@ref(fig:blub) gives an overview of the data. We clearly see a downward trajectory.

Vera Rubin        0                    1928          2016
                                                                               
: Scientists of the 20th century.(\#tab:scientists)

Table \@ref(tab:scientists) lists three women who helped to shape the world as it is.

```{r, results="asis"}
stargazer(head(durationsGe)[1:5],
          title="This is how our data look like.",
          summary=F,
          label = "tab:dura",
          header = F)
```

Table \@ref(tab:dura) gives the first 6 rows and first 5 columns of our data. It clearly shows the problems with automatically created tables: `YearOfBirth` needs reformatting, and `Word` and `Frequency` should not be centered, I think. Of course, `stargazer` can take care of that, provided you figure out all the relevant options.

# Methods and Materials

We applied [methods](#methods) to [materials](#materials).

It can quite generally be said that $$a+b=b+a$$ where $a$ and $b$ are some real numbers and $a+b$ is the sum of $a$ and $b$.

There are

1. things that are not dashes
4. things that are dashes
    - short dashes: -
        a. they are basically not dashes at all, but minus signs.
        z. This fact is rarely relevant.
    - longer dashes: --
    - really long dashes: ---

## Methods

They where great

## Materials

Subjects were told what to do.

**What shall we do?**

Update your `Rmd` file so the output matches this document.

* Add the second Table.
* Take care of the cross reference to it.

If you don't remember the syntax, the cheatsheet or google will surely help. If not, I'm there to help.
