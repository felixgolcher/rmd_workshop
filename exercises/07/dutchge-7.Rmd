**Abstract:**
This paper is about Dutch prefixes. 
It uses an example data set from @Pluymaekers2005, cited by @baayen08 [126,338].

# Introduction

We tried to figure out if the frequency of a word has an influence on the duration of Dutch prefixes. 
Intuitively one could assume that with the duration drops with frequency.
For this we recruited 130 Dutch native speakers.
They produced 421 different words.
Figure 1 gives an overview of the data. We clearly see a downward trajectory.

# Methods and Materials

We applied [methods](#methods) to [materials](#materials).

It can quite generally be said that $$a+b=b+a$$ where $a$ and $b$ are some real numbers and $a+b$ is the sum of $a$ and $b$.

There are

1. things that are not dashes
4. things that are dashes
    - short dashes: -
        a. they are basically not dashes at all, but minus signs.
        z. This fact is rarely relevant.
    - longer dashes: --
    - really long dashes: ---

## Methods

They where great

Here are the [materials](#materials).

**What shall we do?**

Update your `Rmd` file so the output matches `r doc7`.

* add 
  - a `bibliography` variable to the `YAML` header, pointing to the `.bib` file in `exercises.zip`
  - a `cls` variable to the `YAML` header, pointing to the `.cls` file in `exercises.zip`
  - **Remember** what we said about absolute and relative paths.
* Add the two citations in the abstract
  - hint: the second one needs something like `@citekey [pages]`
* Don't forget a header for the references section

If you don't remember the syntax, the cheatsheet or google will surely help. If not, I'm there to help.
