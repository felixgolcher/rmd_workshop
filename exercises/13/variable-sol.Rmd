```{r}
ee <- T
ee
```

This document contains two code chunks which say hello:

```{r, echo=ee, eval=!ee}
message("Hello, I'm Emmy!")
```

```{r, echo=!ee, eval=ee}
message("Hello, I'm Karl!")
```

Task:

* Add another code chunk above the two existing ones.
* Define a variable there
  - It is supposed to take the two values `TRUE` or `FALSE`.
  - What value you actually give it, is arbitrary
* Add the options `echo` and `eval` in a way, that always
  - exactly one chunk is "echoed", but not "evaluated"
  - the other chunk is not "echoed", but "evaluated"
