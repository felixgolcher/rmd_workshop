This slide alone make count to `r tot` min.

Talk about why we make this workshop.

Your experience in class.

## A normal situation

.pull-right-c[
![](image/word1.png)
]

.pull-left-c[
* Lets assume, you write an article. 
* There is text, there are Figures, there are numbers.
* You write the article in Word.
* The analysis is done in (an) R-script(s)
* You might have some collaborators.
* The deadline will be very soon...
]

--

.pull-left-c[
* **uuupsi**
    - We have to exclude 1 experimental subject.
    - All numbers have to change.
    - The figures will have to change as well.
]

???

Normal indeed.

I've seen that! Tell a story

! The article is obviously just a mock fragment to show the formal essence of an article.

---
name: findfigure

## Finding the right figure

The directory where all (really all?) of the figures are, looks like this:

.pull-right-c[
{{content}}
]

```
pictures/
â”œâ”€â”€ dutch-1.png
â”œâ”€â”€ dutch-2.png
â”œâ”€â”€ dutch-3.png
â”œâ”€â”€ final
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ dutch-1.png
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ dutch-2.png
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ dutch-4.png
â”œâ”€â”€ final-2
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ dutch-1.png
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ dutch-2.png
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ dutch-3.png
â””â”€â”€ obsolete
    â”œâ”€â”€ dutch-1.png
    â”œâ”€â”€ dutch-2.png
    â”œâ”€â”€ dutch-3.png
    â”œâ”€â”€ great.png
    â””â”€â”€ not-so-great.png
```

**Which** is the right file?

???

Mention that this is a directory tree...


---
template: findfigure

Was it this one? 

![](image/dutch-N01204.png)
`final/dutch-1.png`
---
template: findfigure

Or this one?

![](image/dutch-right.png)
`final-2/dutch-3.png`

---
template: findfigure

Or that one? 

![](image/dutch-N01033.png)
`dutch-1.png`


---

# We found the figure &mdash; How was it created?

.pull-left-c[
* If you created the image in a script, you *only* have to search all your scripts for that file name.
* If you used the "export" button in Rstudio, you have to find the place yourself.
* In any case you have to hope that the script did not change since then (**git it**).
* This is how your R-script might look: ðŸ¢‚
]

--

.pull-right-c[

```{r, eval=FALSE}
durationsGe %>% as_tibble() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(cFrequency, 
             DurationOfPrefix))+
  geom_point()+
  scale_x_log10()+
  scale_y_log10()+
  geom_smooth(method=lm)+
  theme_bw()

durationsGe %>% as_tibble() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Frequency, 
             DurationOfPrefix))+
  geom_point()+
  scale_x_log10()+
  geom_smooth(method=lm)+
  theme_bw()
```
]

--

**Which is the right version?**

???

What does it mean "to find the place yourself"?

---

# Adapting the numbers

* Did the p value change?
* Where was the p value actually computed?
    - in which script?
    - at which place?
    - We found it. Well, maybe.
        * In the article it says 0.00876
        * The script gives you 0.00871! What the heck is going on?
            - Is it really the right place?
            - Maybe a typo in the article?
            - The R-version changed?
            - We actually got the number from some**where??** else?

--

What is the right version again??
```{r, eval=FALSE}
m0 <- lme4(DurationOfPrefix ~ Frequency + (1|Speaker) + (1|Word), 
           durationsGe)
m2 <- lme4(DurationOfPrefix ~ Frequency + (0|Speaker) + (1|Word), 
           durationsGe)
m1 <- lme4(DurationOfPrefix ~ Frequency + (1|Speaker) + (Sex|Word), 
           durationsGe)
```

--

THE CLOCK IS TICKING. THE PAPER IS DUE. 

---
class: center

# The breaking point

* You found all figures and adapted all figures.
* You think you might have found all numbers. (you have not.)
* you think you have corrected all numbers. (do you? Really?)

--

ðŸ¥³

--

A mail from your co-worker arrives. 

--

...


--

Word doc attached. 

--

...

--

She adapted the same figures and numbers.

--

...

--

Other figures, other numbers. Just slightly so.

```{r, include=FALSE}
delta <- 17
tot <- tot + delta
```

estimate $\Delta$ `r delta`, total `r tot` min. Experience. The story takes time to tell.

# A better world exists

* A RMarkdown document is a text file that mixes descriptive text with R code.
* It can be converted to numerous output formats (PDF, docx, you name it)
* Figures and numbers are directly inserted.

.pull-left-c[

{{content}}

]

.pull-right-c[

In our example you only had to insert the line

```{r, eval=F}
durationsGe <- durationsGe %>% 
  filter(Speaker != "N01033")
```

Then recompile.

## R Markdown &mdash; Why would you want to use it?

- Efficient

   - Combining analysis and text streamlines the thought process.
   - The whole workflow in one work environment (Rstudio)
   - **No** cut'n'paste any more
       - Decreases the possibility of making mistakes in the process.
       - Each bit of the article is easily tracable.
       - Consequences of subtle changes propagate everywhere by themselves.
   - Markdown much easier to learn than $\LaTeX$. Same workflow exists for $\LaTeX$. Even more powerful.

--

- Flexible
    - output to various file formats
        - e.g., HTML, $\LaTeX$, PDF, Word ([caveat](https://twitter.com/patilindrajeets/status/1395298790647771136))
        - that is the *same* source gives different formats.
        - predefined templates/styles exist
    - output to different modalities
        - articles
        - presentations like this one
        - [interactive documents](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) 
        
???

The caveat

Indrajeet Patil
@patilindrajeets

Although #rmarkdown creates all sorts of outputs, not everything will work across outputs. E.g. I love including gifs in docs. This works in HTML but fails when knitted to PDF.

âœ… How can one make doc robust to multiple outputs?

--

- Collaboration: As a text based format, (R)Mardown is ideal for versioning, e.g. using git.


???

```{r, include=FALSE}
delta <- 2
tot <- tot + delta
```

estimate $\Delta$ `r delta`, total `r tot` min.

---

# Extra reason 1: keep it complete!

> Thereâ€™s nothing worse than discovering three months after the fact that youâ€™ve only stored the results of an important calculation in your workspace, not the calculation itself in your code.
> .rightit[ 
[Hadley Wickham](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html) ]

--

**If** you have an RMarkdown document, and **if** you make sure it compiles...

--

... **then** that cannot happen.


---

# Extra reason 2: It's even scriptable &mdash; Use case

**The Problem**

* You test 471 children in their language abilities.
* After the results are in you want (and promised) to notify the parents.
* Doing that manually...
    - ... takes a lot of time
    - ... is guaranteed to produce errors.
    - Those are very hard to find.
    - You don't want to report false results to the parents, do you?

--

**The Solution**

* You write *one* RMarkdown-document.
* This produces the report for _one_ child.
* The child's ID is given as a variable.
* You loop through all children.
* You have 471 reports for 471 children from _one_ source document.

---

## Extra reason 3: Reproducibilty &mdash; After Publication

- After your paper is published, others, including your future self, might like to check your results:

    - Are the correct numbers in the correct context?
    - What exactly was done?
        - Which models where computed?
        - With exactly which parameters?
    - What subgroups/data might have been excluded from the analysis? Correctly so?
    
--

- In the traditional approach this is impossible even if the data are public:
    - You cannot describe what you did so detailed that someone else can reproduce a non-trivial analysis.
    
--

- In an RMarkdown based workflow this is easy:
    - Everything is there.

???

```{r, include=FALSE}
delta <- 4
tot <- tot + delta
```

estimate $\Delta$ `r delta`, total `r tot` min.

---
## The Workshop &mdash; Overview

- 3 days Ã  2 hours, on how to write reproducible research papers with R Markdown

  - A lot of slides, a lot of exercises

--

- Based on back engineering RMarkdown from `PDF`s provided to you.

  - (If we make it there) improving its reproducibility and version-controlling it
  - with a PDF output in mind
      - default is HTML
      - Papers or theses are usually not submitted as HTML

--

- Designed for researchers with basic knowledge of R programming language

  - does not cover programming with R
      - e.g., writing functions    
  - ability to regress, plot, and table in R will be very helpful
      - but not absolutely necessary &mdash; these skills are kindof independent.
  - **If you get stuck because of R problems I will provide you the code. Just ask**

## The Workshop &mdash; Organisation

- We will (heavily) use breakoutrooms of 3 to 4 people.

  - participants learn as much from their partner as from instructors
  - from time to time those will be rearranged.

- You will create your own RMarkdown document(s), not edit something I provide.

  - typing and doing it yourself is a part of the learning process

- When you have a question

  - ask your partner
  - google together
  - ask me & I will join you in your breakoutroom.

## The Workshop &mdash; Organisation &mdash; Slides

Slides with this background colour indicate that your action is required, for

- setting the workshop up
    - e.g., downloading course material 
    
- completing the exercises
    - e.g., managing references in R Markdown
    - these slides (usually) have countdown timers
    
    
`r countdown(minutes = 3, seconds = 00, top = 0)`

---


## The Workshop &mdash; Organisation &mdash; Slides

- Codes and texts that go in R Markdown documents .inline-c[appear as such &mdash; in a different font, on gray background]
    - long codes and texts will have their own line(s)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = h5_median, y = h5_index, color = subfield)) +
       geom_point() +
       facet_wrap(. ~ branch) +
       scale_colour_discrete(name = "Journal Type", breaks = c(0, 1),
                             labels = c("Generalist", "Subfield"))    
```

---
## The Workshop &mdash; Organisation &mdash; Slides

- Codes and texts that go in R Markdown documents .inline-c[appear as such &mdash; in a different font, on gray background]
    - long codes and texts will have their own line(s)

- Results that come out in output files .out-t[appear as such &mdash; in the same font, on green background]
    - except very obvious results, such as figures and tables
    
--
    
- Specific sections are .yellow-h[highlighted yellow as such] for emphasis
    - these could be for anything &mdash; codes and texts in input, results in output, and/or texts on slides
    
--

- The slides are designed for self-study as much as for the workshop
    - *accessible*, in substance and form, to go through on your own

---
## The Workshop &mdash; Aims

- To make you aware of what is possible with R Markdown

  - we will cover a large breath of issues, not all of it is for long-term memory
      - one reason why the slides are designed for self study as well    
<br>
  - awareness of what is possible, `Google`, and perseverance are all we need

--

- To encourage you to move to R Markdown 

  - Having practiced lowers the threshold of actually using it.
  - Having understood the power of it raises motivation

class: action

## R Markdown Document &mdash; Create from within RStudio

- Create a new R Markdown document from the RStudio menu:<sup>*</sup> 

> `File -> New File -> R Markdown -> OK`

- Save your new document:

> `File -> Save`

- I recommend to use a fresh directory to save the file in. (e.g. `rmd_workshop`)
    - usually an RMarkdown script represents a statistical analysis.
    - There might data. They would go in something like `rmd_workshop/data`
    - There might be additional images, e.g. in `rmd_workshop/images`
    - Maybe other files like bibliography style files.
- If you organize everything in subdirectories below your Rmd-file you can
    - zip it and share it
    - push it to git as is
    - move it around on your computer(s)
    - and everything still works the same: âœ…

- Observe that your file automatically got the extension `.Rmd`.

## R Markdown Document &mdash; Components

* What you get is a predefined template. 
* The document has three components

--

.pull-left-c[

* **YAML**: 
  - Meta information and 
  - processing instructions 
  - in a nested key-value-scheme.

]

.pull-right-c[

![](image/yaml.png)

]

--

.pull-left-c[

* **text**: 
  - Human readable. 
  - Peppered with basic formatting information. 
  - the **Markdown** part of R**Markdown**

]

.pull-right-c[

![](image/text.png)

]

<br>

--

.pull-left-c[

* **code chunks**: 
  - regions framed by special tags containing R code. 
  - the **R**part of **R**Markdown

]

.pull-right-c[

## R Markdown Document &mdash; Compile

.pull-left-c[
- Click the `Knit` button to compile
  - An output document pops up in another window (or similar things happen)
  - You find this new document in the directory you placed the Rmd in.
  - the output document has the same base name as your `.Rmd` document
  - the extension should be `.html` by default.
]
.pull-right-c[

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "95%"}
knitr::include_graphics("image/first_rmd.png")
```

]

--

.pull-left-c[
* Click the â–¼ to the right of the `Knit` button
  - choose "knit to pdf" from the appearing dropdown.
  - A `PDF` viewer should pop up
  - if you get an error about a missing $\LaTeX$ installation:
    - install `tinytex` `r cp("tinytex")`
```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
install.packages(c("rmarkdown"))
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```
* For the remainder of the course we will focus on PDF.

## R Markdown Document &mdash; Compilation Process 

- When you `Knit`, the following happens: 

**`.Rmd`** (RMarkdown) $\xrightarrow[\text{runs R code}]{\text{knitr}}$ **`.md`** (Markdown) $\xrightarrow[\text{converts}]{\text{pandoc}}$ whatevery **output** form and format you desire!

- `knitr`<sup>*</sup>
     - is an R package, a central and powerful one.
     - executes the code chunks
     - optionally replacing it with the results 
     - pure `.md` (Markdown) remains.

- `pandoc`<sup>**</sup> transforms the .md document into your preferred output format(s)
     - is **not** an R package, but a standalone conversion wonder program
     - e.g., HTML, $\LaTeX$, PDF, Word
     - RStudio comes with a copy of `pandoc` ([http://pandoc.org](http://pandoc.org)), so you do not have to install it separately. 
- This process is automated by the `rmarkdown` package


---
## R Markdown Document &mdash; Notes

- Behind the scenes, each .Rmd file is compiled in its own session, and therefore

  - the code needs to stand alone, for reproducibility reasons
  - you might have already loaded a package and/or imported data elsewhere (e.g., in a separate .R and/or .Rmd file), but even in the same session, these won't be available to a given .Rmd file

--

- R Markdown can produce more than scientific reports,<sup>*</sup> including
  - presentations, for example with `xaringan`  `r cp("xaringan")`, like this one
  - books, with `bookdown` `r cp("bookdown")`
  - websites, with `blogdown` `r cp("blogdown")`
  - interactive web applications, with `shiny` `r cp("shiny")`
* Here we will focus mostly on research papers, maybe with a digression to presentations.

## YAML &mdash; Overview

.Rmd documents start<sup>*</sup> with YAML
- it includes the metadata variables
    - e.g., title, output format    
<br>    
- it is written between a pair of three hyphens .yellow-h[-]

```{r, eval = FALSE}
---
title: 
output:
---
```


.footnote[

<sup>*</sup> Technically, we can place YAML anywhere in a .Rmd document. However, it is a good practice to start with YAML so that the metadata is easly accessbile.

]

---
## YAML &mdash; Variables

- `title` and `output` are the basic variables of YAML
    - variable names are typed in lower case, followed by a colon <span style="background-color: #ffff88;">:</span>
<br>
    - the list of available variables, as well as options and sub-options for these variables, depends on the output format
       - [Pandoc User's Guide](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html) provides a comprehensive documentation
       - R Markdown Cheat Sheet provides a helpful list

- Typical YAML variables for an research paper:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
---
title: 
author: 
date: 
bibliography: 
csl: 
output: 
---
```

title: "Journals: Random Words With Random Data^[Preliminary draft. Please do not cite or circulate without permission from the author.]"
subtitle: A Mock Paper for an R Markdown Workshop
author: "Jane Doe^[Department of Science, University of Random. Email: jane.doe@random.edu. Website: http://www.janedoe.com.]"                                    
date: 4 May 2020 
bibliography: references.bib   #<<
csl: apa_7th.csl               #<<  
output: pdf_document

```

---
## YAML &mdash; Strings

```{r, eval = FALSE}

...
bibliography: references/ref_library.bib                                               #<<
csl: /home/flx/hu/statistik/register/rmd_workshop/manuscript/apa_7th.csl     #<<
...
---
```

Those strings can be

* *relative* paths like `references/ref_library.bib`. With RMarkdown they start in the directory where the script resides.
* *absolute* paths, starting at the directory tree root like 
  * `/home/flx/hu/statistik/register/rmd_workshop/manuscript/apa_7th.csl` (Linux/Mac) or 
  * `C:\Users\you\Documents\style.css` (Windows)

But **never ever** use absolute paths in an RMarkdown document

* otherwise you cannot share it
* **why?** No one will have exactly your directory structure as you.
???

We already mentioned something similar: Self contained directories.

---
## YAML &mdash; Options and Sub-Options

.pull-left-c[

Options can have sub-options

```{r, eval = FALSE}

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("image/yaml4.png")

        keep_tex: true    #<<
---
```

]

.pull-right[

Notice that

- this specific setting, highlighted, will create multiple outputs
    - a $\LaTeX$ and a PDF document

- all but the last option (i.e., `true`) takes a colon

- options and sub-options (except the last option, again) are stepwise indented 
   - exactly with four spaces
   - the alignment between the colons for `pdf_document` and `keep_tex` is coincidental

## YAML &mdash; R Code

.pull-left-c[

Variables can take code as well

```{r, eval = FALSE}

Notice that

- such codes can be particularly useful for variables 
    - that need frequent updates
    - and that can be automatically updated
        - e.g., `date`

- there are quotation marks around the code

- we'll cover codes in .Rmd documents later on in the workshop

]

**Remark**

* The strange quotation mark like things around the code .yellow-h["&#96;"] are called "backticks".
* They are usually only used as *grave accent*.
* How to find?

## Exercise

1. Open your `Rmd` file and fill in the YAML variables for the mock paper

2. Compile to `PDF`

3. Cycle through 1. and 2. until your `PDF` reproduces `r doc1` as closely as possible.
    - Use an author name of your liking.
    - Make sure to remove the table of contents.
    - Pay attention to the font size.
    - Make the date string dynamic. R hint:
```{r}
Sys.Date()
```

Getting help:

* Ask your room mates
* Google
* Don't hesitate to call me in.

The task description is added to `r doc1` as well.

## Syntax &mdash; Overview

- R Markdown follows the syntax in Pandoc's Markdown 
   - That is quite important, since Markdown is not fully defined as `HTML` or `PDF`.   
   - for the complete rules of the syntax, see [Pandoc User's Guide](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html)
   - for a useful summary of the syntax, see the R Markdown Cheat Sheet

---
## Syntax &mdash; Lines

Multiple spaces on a given line are reduced to one:

```{r eval = FALSE}
This is a sentence followed by four spaces.    This is another sentence on the same line.
```

.out-t[This is a sentence followed by four spaces.    This is another sentence on the same line.]

Line endings with fewer than two spaces are ignored:

```{r eval = FALSE}
It is generally no bad idea to put each sentence on a new line.
The output text does not show the line breaks.
But versioning programs like git work on a line by line basis.
By dividing the text into more than one line per paragraph we avoid conflicts.
Those might otherwise arise whenever your collaborators edit a different sentence 
within the same long paragraph.
```

.out-t[It is generally no bad idea to put each sentence on a new line.

Those might otherwise arise whenever your collaborators edit a different sentence 
within the same long paragraph.
]

---
## Syntax &mdash; Hard Breakes

* Two or more spaces at the end of lines 
* or the tag `<br>` (for `html`) / `\newline` (for $\LaTeX$)

introduce hard brakes, forcing a new line

```{r eval = FALSE}
This is a sentence followed by two spaces.`  `
This is another sentence on a new line.<br>
This is another sentence on another line.
```

.out-t[This is a sentence followed by two spaces.  
This is another sentence on a new line.<br>
This is another sentence on another line.
]

---
## Syntax &mdash; Line Blocks

Spaces in lines starting with a vertical line .yellow-h[|] are kept

```{r eval = FALSE}
| a one-space indent
|     a five-space indent
|          a ten-space indent  
```

.out-t[

&nbsp;a one-space indent  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a five-space indent  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a ten-space indent  

]

---
## Syntax &mdash; Block Quotes

Lines starting with the greater-than sign .yellow-h[&#62;] introduce block quotes

```{r, eval=FALSE}
> In God, we trust. All others must bring data. 
>
> --- Anonymous 

```

.out-t[

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In God, we trust. All others must bring data.    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &mdash; Anonymous
]
---
## Syntax &mdash; Paragraphs

One or more<sup>*</sup> blank lines introduce a new paragraph

```{r eval = FALSE}

This is the first sentence of a paragraph as it is preceded by a blank line. This is the second 
sentence of that paragraph, which is followed by a blank line. 

This is the first sentence of a *new paragraph* as it is preceded by a blank line. This is the 
second sentence of that paragraph, which is followed by a blank line.

```

.out-t[

This is the first sentence of a paragraph as it is preceded by a blank line. This is the second 
sentence of that paragraph, which is followed by a blank line.

This is the first sentence of a *new paragraph* as it is preceded by a blank line. This is the 
second sentence of that paragraph, which is followed by a blank line.

]

.footnote[

<sup>*</sup> Multiple blank lines between paragraphs reduce to one.

]

---
## Syntax &mdash; Comments

Text with the syntax .inline-c[<!--].inline-c[comments -->] is omitted from output

```md
<!-- This paragraph needs re-writing -->
This is the first sentence of a paragraph as it is preceded by a blank line. This is the second 
sentence of that paragraph, which is followed by a blank line. 

This is the first sentence of a new paragraph <!-- I've removed italics --> as it is preceded 
by a blank line. This is the second sentence of that paragraph, which is followed by a blank 
line. 

```

.out-t[

This is the first sentence of a paragraph as it is preceded by a blank line. This is the second 
sentence of that paragraph, which is followed by a blank line.

This is the first sentence of a new paragraph as it is preceded by a blank line. This is the

## Exercise

Update your `Rmd` file so the output matches `r doc2`.

* Avoid very long lines by putting one sentence per line.

## Syntax &mdash; Headers

The number sign .yellow-h[&#x23;] introduces headers; lower levels are created with additional signs &mdash; up to total five levels

.pull-left[

.inline-c[&#x23; Introduction] becomes

.out-t[

# Introduction

]

.inline-c[&#x23;&#x23; 1. Research Review] becomes

.out-t[

## 1. Research Review

]

]

.pull-right[

.inline-c[&#x23;&#x23;&#x23; 3.1.2 Materials] becomes

.out-t[

### 3.1.2 Materials

]

.inline-c[&#x23;&#x23;&#x23;&#x23; 4th order subsection] becomes

.out-t[

#### 4th order subsection

]

.inline-c[&#x23;&#x23;&#x23;&#x23;&#x23; 5th order subsection] becomes

.out-t[

##### 5th order subsection

]

]

???

How the headers are actually rendered heavily depends on the output format.

* HTML: usually no auto numbering
* PDF: usually auto numbering of everything

---
## Syntax &mdash; Emphases 

* A pair of single asterisk .yellow-h[&#42;] or underscores .yellow-h[&#95;] introduces italics

<span style="background-color: #e5e5e5; border-radius: 3px; padding: 4px; font-family: 'Source Code Pro', 'Lucida Console', Monaco, monospace;">&#42;italics&#42;</span> becomes .out-t[*italics*]    

<span style="background-color: #e5e5e5; border-radius: 3px; padding: 4px; font-family: 'Source Code Pro', 'Lucida Console', Monaco, monospace;">&#95;italics&#95;</span> becomes .out-t[*italics*] as well


* A pair of double asterisk or underscores introduces bold  

<span style="background-color: #e5e5e5; border-radius: 3px; padding: 4px; font-family: 'Source Code Pro', 'Lucida Console', Monaco, monospace;">&#42;&#42;bold&#42;&#42;</span> becomes .out-t[**bold**]

<span style="background-color: #e5e5e5; border-radius: 3px; padding: 4px; font-family: 'Source Code Pro', 'Lucida Console', Monaco, monospace;">&#95;&#95;bold&#95;&#95;</span> becomes .out-t[**bold**] as well

* These two rules can be combined

<span style="background-color: #e5e5e5; border-radius: 3px; padding: 4px; font-family: 'Source Code Pro', 'Lucida Console', Monaco, monospace;">&#42;&#42;&#95;bolditalics&#95;&#42;&#42;</span> becomes .out-t[**_bolditalics_**]

<span style="background-color: #e5e5e5; border-radius: 3px; padding: 4px; font-family: 'Source Code Pro', 'Lucida Console', Monaco, monospace;">&#95;&#42;&#42;bolditalics&#42;&#42;&#95;</span> becomes .out-t[_**bolditalics**_]  as well

* Typewriter font (inline code, file names, R package names, etc) 

<span style="background-color: #e5e5e5; border-radius: 3px; padding: 4px; font-family: 'Source Code Pro', 'Lucida Console', Monaco, monospace;">&#96;package</span><span style="background-color: #e5e5e5; border-radius: 3px; padding: 4px; font-family: 'Source Code Pro', 'Lucida Console', Monaco, monospace;">&#96;</span> becomes .out-t[`package`]

## Syntax &mdash; Strikethrough

A pair of double tildes .yellow-h[~] introduces strikethrough

<span style="background-color: #e5e5e5; border-radius: 3px; padding: 4px; font-family: 'Source Code Pro', 'Lucida Console', Monaco, monospace;">&#126;&#126;strikethrough&#126;&#126;</span> becomes .out-t[~~strikethrough~~]

<br>

Strikethrough can be combined with italics or bold

<span style="background-color: #e5e5e5; border-radius: 3px; padding: 4px; font-family: 'Source Code Pro', 'Lucida Console', Monaco, monospace;">&#42;&#42;&#126;&#126;strikebold&#126;&#126;&#42;&#42;</span> or <span style="background-color: #e5e5e5; border-radius: 3px; padding: 4px; font-family: 'Source Code Pro', 'Lucida Console', Monaco, monospace;">&#95;&#95;&#126;&#126;strikebold&#126;&#126;&#95;&#95;</span>, they both become .out-t[**~~strikebold~~**]

<span style="background-color: #e5e5e5; border-radius: 3px; padding: 4px; font-family: 'Source Code Pro', 'Lucida Console', Monaco, monospace;">&#126;&#126;&#42;&#42;strikebold&#42;&#42;&#126;&#126;</span> or <span style="background-color: #e5e5e5; border-radius: 3px; padding: 4px; font-family: 'Source Code Pro', 'Lucida Console', Monaco, monospace;">&#126;&#126;&#95;&#95;strikebold&#95;&#95;&#126;&#126;</span>, they both become .out-t[~~**strikebold**~~] as well

name: internal-links

## Syntax &mdash; Links &mdash; Internal<sup>*</sup>

You can link text to section headers in the same document

<span style="background-color: #e5e5e5; border-radius: 3px; padding: 4px; font-family: 'Source Code Pro', 'Lucida Console', Monaco, monospace;">&#91;Conclusion](#conclusion)</span> becomes .out-t[[Conclusion](#internal-links)], and a click takes the screen to that section

<br>

Multi-word headers need hyphenation

<span style="background-color: #e5e5e5; border-radius: 3px; padding: 4px; font-family: 'Source Code Pro', 'Lucida Console', Monaco, monospace;">&#91;Literature Review](#literature-review)</span> becomes .out-t[[Literature Review](#internal-links)], and it works only if the second part is hyphenated

.footnote[

<sup>*</sup> The [links to references](#reference-links), [figures](#autoref-figures), and [tables](#autoref-tables) are covered later on.

]

---
## Syntax &mdash; Links &mdash; External

You can link text to URLs

<span style="background-color: #e5e5e5; border-radius: 3px; padding: 4px; font-family: 'Source Code Pro', 'Lucida Console', Monaco, monospace;">&#91;visit my website](https&#58;//www.linguistik.hu-berlin.de/de/staff/golcherf)</span> becomes .out-t[[visit my website](https://www.linguistik.hu-berlin.de/de/staff/golcherf)]

<span style="background-color: #e5e5e5; border-radius: 3px; padding: 4px; font-family: 'Source Code Pro', 'Lucida Console', Monaco, monospace;">&#91;https&#58;//resulumit.com](https&#58;//resulumit.com/)</span> becomes .out-t[[https://resulumit.com](https://resulumit.com/)]

<span style="background-color: #e5e5e5; border-radius: 3px; padding: 4px; font-family: 'Source Code Pro', 'Lucida Console', Monaco, monospace;">&#60;https&#58;//resulumit.com></span> becomes .out-t[<https://resulumit.com>] as well

--

<br>

You can also link text to an email address

<span style="background-color: #e5e5e5; border-radius: 3px; padding: 4px; font-family: 'Source Code Pro', 'Lucida Console', Monaco, monospace;">&#91;email me](mailto&#58;felix.golcher@hu-berlin.de)</span><sup>*</sup> becomes .out-t[[email me](mailto:felix.golcher@hu-berlin.de)]

<span style="background-color: #e5e5e5; border-radius: 3px; padding: 4px; font-family: 'Source Code Pro', 'Lucida Console', Monaco, monospace;">&#60;felix.golcher@hu-berlin.de&#62;</span> becomes .out-t[<felix.golcher@hu-berlin.de>]

.footnote[

<sup>*</sup> Notice the prefix .yellow-h[mailto:] in the syntax

```

solution $\Delta$ `r delta`, total `r tot` min.


`r countdown(minutes = 5, seconds = 00, top = 0)`

## Syntax &mdash; Equations

Inline equations go between a pair of single dollar signs <span style="background-color: #ffff88;">&#x24;</span> &mdash; with no space between the signs and the equation itself

.inline-c[$E = mc^{2}$] becomes .out-t[*E = mc<sup>2</sup>*]

<br>

--

Block equations go in between a pair of double dollar signs &mdash; with or without spaces, it works

.inline-c[&#x24;&#x24;  E = mc^{2}].inline-c[&#x24;&#x24;] becomes


.out-t[

<center> <i> E = mc<sup>2</sup> </i> </center>

]


<br>


.inline-c[$$E = mc_{2}].inline-c[$$] becomes

.out-t[
<center> <i> E = mc<sub>2</sub> </i> </center>
]

---
## Syntax &mdash; Footnotes &mdash; Inline Notes

For inline footnotes, use the .inline-c[^[footnote]] syntax

.inline-c[Jane Doe^[Corresponding author.]] becomes .out-t[Jane Doe<sup>1</sup>]

<br>

.footnote[

.out-t[<sup>1</sup> Corresponding author.]

]

--

Notice that 

- the caret sign .yellow-h[^] comes .yellow-h[before] the left square bracket .yellow-h[&#91;]
- this syntax works in YAML as well as in text
    - footnotes in YAML get symbols, in text they get numbers

---
## Syntax &mdash; Footnotes &mdash; Notes with Identifiers

An alternative is to use the .inline-c[[^identifier]] syntax, with identifiers defined elsewhere in the same document

```{r eval = FALSE}
Dr Doe holds a PhD in rock science.[^defence_date]

[^defence_date]: She defended her thesis in 2017.
```

.out-t[Dr Doe holds a PhD in rock science.<sup>1</sup>] 
   
<br>

.footnote[

.out-t[<sup>1</sup> She defended her thesis in 2017.]

]

--

Notice that 

- the caret sign comes .yellow-h[after] the left square bracket
- this syntax works in text, but not in YAML

???

```{r, include=FALSE}
delta <- 2
tot <- tot + delta
```

estimate $\Delta$ `r delta`, total `r tot` min.

---
class: action

## Exercise

Update your `Rmd` file so the output matches `r doc5`.

* Make the contact information of the corresponding author a footnote.
* Add the equation with it's inline information.

???

```{r, include=FALSE}
delta <- 5
tot <- tot + delta
```

estimate $\Delta$ `r delta`, total `r tot` min.

```{r, include=FALSE}
delta <- 5
tot <- tot + delta
```

solution $\Delta$ `r delta`, total `r tot` min.


`r countdown(minutes = 5, seconds = 00, top = 0)`

---
## Syntax &mdash; Lists

Lines starting with asterisk .yellow-h[&#42;] as well as plus .yellow-h[&#43;] or minus .yellow-h[&#8722;] signs introduce lists

```{r eval=FALSE}
- books
- articles
- reports
```

.out-t[

- books
- articles
- reports

]

---
## Syntax &mdash; Lists &mdash; Nesting

Lists can be nested within each other, with indentation

```{r eval=FALSE}
+ books
+ articles
    - published
    - under review
        + revised and resubmitted
    - work in progress
```

.out-t[

+ books
+ articles
    - published
    - under review
        + revised and resubmitted
    - work in progress

]

---
## Syntax &mdash; Lists &mdash; Numbering

List items can be numbered

```{r eval=FALSE}
1. books
3. articles
    - published
    - under review
        + revised and resubmitted
    - work in progress
```

.out-t[

1. books
3. articles
    - published
    - under review
        + revised and resubmitted
    - work in progress

]

**Remark:** The numbering has not to be ordered correctly. If you move around items, they are renumbered correctly in the output.

---
## Syntax &mdash; Dashes

Two hyphens grouped together introduce an en-dash

.inline-c[&#8208;&#8208;] becomes .out-t[&ndash;]

<br>

Three hyphens grouped together introduce an em-dash

.inline-c[&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;] becomes .out-t[&mdash;]

---
## Syntax &mdash; Subscript and Superscript

.pull-left[

A pair of tildes introduces subscript

.inline-c[CO&#126;2&#126;] becomes .out-t[CO<sub>2</sub>]

<br>

A pair of carets introduces superscript

.inline-c[R&#94;2&#94;] becomes .out-t[R<sup>2</sup>]

]

---
## Syntax &mdash; Sub- and Super-scripts

.pull-left[

A pair of tildes introduces subscript

.inline-c[CO&#126;2&#126;] becomes .out-t[CO<sub>2</sub>]

<br>

A pair of carets introduces subscript

.inline-c[R&#94;2&#94;] becomes .out-t[R<sup>2</sup>]

]

.pull-right[

Notice that

- the syntax here (Markdown-based) is different than the one for equations ($\LaTeX$-based)
    - e.g., <span style="background-color: #e5e5e5; border-radius: 3px; padding: 4px; font-family: 'Source Code Pro', 'Lucida Console', Monaco, monospace;">R&#94;2&#94;</span> versus <span style="background-color: #e5e5e5; border-radius: 3px; padding: 4px; font-family: 'Source Code Pro', 'Lucida Console', Monaco, monospace;"> mc^{2}</span>

## Static Figures & Images &mdash; Markdown Syntax

The syntax <span style="background-color: #e5e5e5; border-radius: 3px; padding: 4px; font-family: 'Source Code Pro', 'Lucida Console', Monaco, monospace;">!&#91;Figure Caption&#93;(figure.extension)</span> embeds images, and/or figures produced elsewhere,<sup>*</sup> into .Rmd documents
 
- similar to the link syntax, only this time it is preceded by an exclamation mark .yellow-h[!]
- goes outside code chunks, on a new line
- simple, but not very customisable
    
.footnote[

<sup>*</sup> Ideally, reproducible papers should produce their own images with data and code. However, there might be situations where this is not possible.

]

???

xxx Cross references should be introduced here. Than it is a bit interesting at least.

knitr::include_graphics("image/crc1412.png")
```

<center>.yellow-h[Figure 1]: The CRC logo. </center>

---
## Figures &mdash; Images &mdash; Markdown Syntax

The syntax can accept `width` or `height` attributes as follows

```{r, eval=FALSE}
![The CRC logo](image/crc1412.png)`{ width=40% }`
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="40%"}

## References &mdash; Bibliography Database

.pull-left-c[
- References are defined in .bib files
    - they follow the BibTeX format

<br>

- `pandoc` looks for a .bib file, and for the definitions therein, to process citations
    - .bib files are specified with the `bibliography` variable in YAML

<br>


- `pandoc` can process a citation only if there is a linked entry in the .bib file
    - but not all entries have to be cited

]


.pull-right-c[

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("image/bib.png")
```

---
## References &mdash; Bibliography Database &mdash; Entries

.pull-left-c[

- A BibTeX entry consists of three elements

   - a type
       - e.g., `@article`    
<br>
   - a citation-key
       - e.g., `bennett2015`    
<br>
   - a number of tags
       - e.g., `title`, `author`

- Different tags are available for different reference types
    - some tags are required, others are optional

## References &mdash; Bibliography Database &mdash; Entries

- One could create entries by hand
    - this requires knowing the BibTeX format, entry types, tags, and related information about references to be cited
        - this is not efficient
    
- A good alternative is to use `Google Scholar`, which provides BibTeX entries
    - follow `cite -> BibTex` and copy
    - paste into .bib, edit if necessary, and save
    
- Some publishers and journals provide BibTeX entries on their website as well

---
## References &mdash; Style

.pull-left-c[

- Reference styles are defined in .csl files
    - files for different styles (e.g., APA) are available at [https://www.zotero.org/styles](https://www.zotero.org/styles)

<br>

- `pandoc` looks for a .csl file, and for the styles therein, to style citations and references
    - .csl files are specified with the `csl` variable in YAML
    - if unspecified, it uses a Chicago author-date format
    

<br>

- .csl files affect the style only in outputs
    - no matter which the style is used, the citation syntax in .Rmd documents remains the same

## Citations &mdash; Reference List

The list of references appears after the last line of the document, with no section header 
- so that you can choose the header yourself, by ending .Rmd documents with a header of your choice

```{r eval=FALSE}
This is the last sentence of a manuscript with an APA style.

## References

## References &mdash; Internal Links

For internal links from in-text citations to the reference list, set .inline-c[link-citations: yes] in YAML

- a click on these links takes the screen to the relevant entry in the list
- the `linkcolor` variable make these links explicit
    - setting this is not necessary for the links to work &mdash; the default is black
       
```{r, eval = FALSE}

## Exercise

Update your `Rmd` file so the output matches `r doc7`.

* add 
  - a `bibliography` variable to the `YAML` header, pointing to the `.bib` file in `exercises.zip`
  - a `cls` variable to the `YAML` header, pointing to the `.cls` file in `exercises.zip`
  - **Remember** what we said about absolute and relative paths.
* Add the two citations in the abstract
  - hint: the second one needs something like `@citekey [pages]`
* Don't forget a header for the references section

```{r, include=FALSE}
mn <- 7
sec <- 30
delta <- mn + sec/60

# Part 6. The R of Rmarkdown: Code Chunks and Inline Code

.footnote[

[Back to the contents slide](#contents-slide).

]

---
## Code &mdash; Overview

Most codes go inside code chunks
- e.g., code that imports and cleans data, and/or produces tables and/or figures 

````md
`r ''````{r}
data("durationsGe", package = "languageR")
durationsGe %>% as_tibble() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Frequency, DurationOfPrefix))+
  geom_point()+
  scale_x_log10()+
  scale_y_log10()+
  geom_smooth(method=lm)
```
````

Codes can also go in line with text
- e.g., code that results in a single statistic

```{r, eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
The average duration of the prefix was \`r mean(durationsGe$DurationOfPrefix)`.
```

Which compiles to .out-t[The average duration of the prefix was `r mean(durationsGe$DurationOfPrefix)`.]


---
## Code Chunks &mdash; Overview

- Code chunks are delimited spaces between a pair of three backticks
    - below is an empty chunk for R code

````md
`r ''````{r}

```
````

- `r` is an option of the chunk, indicating that the code in the chunk above should be run by R
    - it could have been `python`, which we will not cover in this workshop
    - options go in a pair of curly brackets, on the same line with the first delimiter

- Chunks can be placed anywhere in .Rmd documents
    - their output, if there is any, might float around text to avoid breaking across pages

---
## Code Chunks &mdash; Labels

It is recommended to label the code chunks, which are otherwise automatically numbered.
- informative labels can be helpful 
  - for navigating through error messages as
  - well as filenames of plots and cache
  - in the example below, the chunk is labelled as `data_import`
<br>
- but **note** that duplicate labels lead to an error during compilation

```{r, include=FALSE}
durationsGe %>%
  filter(!is.na(Speaker)) %>% 
  select(-NumberSegmentsOnset) -> durationsGe
```


````md
`r ''````{r `data_import`}

data("durationsGe", package = "languageR") # import data durationsGe from languageR
durationsGe %>% # remove one column
  select(-NumberSegmentsOnset) -> durationsGe

```
````

---
## Code Chunks &mdash; Options

- Code chunks take options, listed on the same line with the first delimiter, in curly brackets

- avoid spaces around the equal sign <span style="background-color: #ffff88;">=</span> between option tags and values
  - such spaces might lead to errors
- in the example below, the chunk is labelled as **`setup`**, and and the **`include`** option is set to **`FALSE`**.


````md
`r ''````{r setup, `include=FALSE`}

some code

```
````

- $\Rightarrow$ Nothing from this chunk will be included in the output document.
  - The computations will be done nevertheless.
  - This is extremely helpful for writing publications.
  - you don't want your data import and cleaning clutter up your document.
- The list of options is available at <https://yihui.org/knitr/options>

    - R Markdown Cheat Sheet provides a helpful list as well


---
## Code Chunks &mdash; Options &mdash; Defaults

Options have default values

- e.g., for **`echo`**, the default is **`TRUE`**
      - **`echo`**: should the source code printed in the output?
      - **`TRUE`**: yes it should   
<br>
- therefore the following two chunks have the same function

````md
`r ''````{r}
some code
```
````

````md
`r ''````{r, `echo=TRUE`}
some code
```
````

* You might want to change that default for a research paper:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=FALSE) # placed in the 1st code chunk
```


---

## Code Chunks &mdash; Options &mdash; Defaults

The following chunk prints two things in the output document:

````md
`r ''````{r}
head(durationsGe, 4)
```
````

1) the code itself

.out-t[
`head(durationsGe, 4)`
]

2) the head of the data frame (The first lines, 4 in this case)


.out-t[

```{r, echo=FALSE}
head(durationsGe,4)
```

]

---
## Code Chunks &mdash; Suppress Code Echo

Setting .inline-c[echo=FALSE] prevents the code from being displayed in the output document

````md
`r ''````{r ... `echo=FALSE`}
head(durationsGe, 4)
```
````

This chunk therefore prints one thing in the output document &mdash; the head of the data frame


.out-t[

```{r, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
head(durationsGe, 4)
```

]

---
## Code Chunks &mdash; Suppress Output Display

Prevent the result(s) of the source code from being displayed in the output document

````md
`r ''````{r ... `results="hide"`}
head(durationsGe, 4)
```
````

This chunk therefore prints one thing in the output document &mdash; the source code

.out-t[

`head(durationsGe, 4)`

]

Setting .inline-c[results="asis"] passes the results as they are produced by the code &mdash; `pandoc` does not transform these. In creating tables for PDF output with the `stargazer` package, this option is a must.

---
## Code Chunks &mdash; Suppress Both

Consequently, both options combined result in the output document being silent about the whole chunk.

````md
`r ''````{r ... `results="hide"`, `echo=FALSE`}
head(durationsGe, 4)
```
````

There is nothing in the output document.

* You would not (normally) do that with code that *only does* output something.
* A helpful option to completely silent chunks is **`include=FALSE`**

---
## Code Chunks &mdash; Other Useful Options

**`cache=TRUE`**: Store results for future compilations 

````md
`r ''````{r ... `cache=TRUE`}
some code that might run days
```
````

--

**`eval=FALSE`**: Prevent R from running the code in the chunk altogether 

````md
`r ''````{r ... `eval=FALSE`}
some code I want to show being wrong in class
```
````

--

**`error/message/warning=TRUE`**: Prevent messages and/or warnings from being displayed in the output

````md
`r ''````{r ... `error=FALSE`, `message=FALSE`, `warning=FALSE`}
chatty code being silenced
```
````


---
## Code Chunks &mdash; The Setup Chunk

Conventionally, the first code chunk is used for general setup, where you can

- define .yellow-h[your own defaults] for chunk options, with `knitr::opts_chunk$set()`
    - avoids repeating chunk options    
- load the necessary packages    
- import raw data

````md
`r ''````{r, setup, include=FALSE}

# `chunk option defaults`
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=FALSE, message=FALSE)

# `packages`
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(stargazer)

# `data`
df_raw <- read.csv("journals.csv")

```
````

---
## Code Chunks &mdash; The Data Chunk

Often, the second chunk is used for the main operations on raw data
- e.g., for data cleaning and other transformations
- some minor transformations could be left to lower chunks
    - e.g., capitalizing variable names for figures
        
````md
`r ''````{r, data, echo=FALSE ...}

df <- df_raw `%>%`
      `...`

```
````

---
## Inline Code &mdash; Overview

Code can also be incorporated in text, with the <span style="background-color: #e5e5e5; border-radius: 3px; padding: 4px; font-family: 'Source Code Pro', 'Lucida Console', Monaco, monospace;"><code>&grave;r &grave;</code></span> syntax

- unlike chunks, these do not take options   
<br>
- the output document will display the result of the code
    - in the exact place of the source code   
<br>
- the result of the code will have the same formatting with the text
---
## Inline Code &mdash; Examples

```{r, eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
If we multiply _pi_ by 5, we get \`r pi * 5`.
```

.out-t[If we multiply _pi_ by 5, we get `r pi * 5`.]

<hr style="height:10px; visibility:hidden;" />
--

```{r, eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
The average duration of the prefix was \`r mean(durationsGe$DurationOfPrefix)` s, which would 
round to \`r signif(mean(durationsGe$DurationOfPrefix), 3) s`.
```

.out-t[The average duration of the prefix was `r mean(durationsGe$DurationOfPrefix)` s, which would 
round to `r signif(mean(durationsGe$DurationOfPrefix), 3)` s.]

<hr style="height:10px; visibility:hidden;" />
--

```{r, eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
There were \`r length(unique(durationsGe$Speaker))` speakers in the data set.
```

.out-t[There were `r length(unique(durationsGe$Speaker))` speakers in the data set.]

<hr style="height:10px; visibility:hidden;" />
--

**Recommendation**: All (each and every) numbers should be rendered by inline code and **not** copypasted. Otherwise, you are giving away the advantages of the whole thing.

## Exercise

Update your `Rmd` file so the output matches `r doc8`.

```{r, include=F}
sleep <- sleep[1:10,]
```

* add a setup chunk
  - set the default chunk options `echo`, `warning`, and `message` to `FALSE`
  - load the packages `tidyverse` and `stargazer`.
     - install them if they are not yet installed.
  - add the following line of code to load the data we need:
```{r, eval=F}
data("durationsGe", package = "languageR")
```
- Render the two bold faced numbers as inline code
  - hint: Example code
```{r}
a <- c(1,2,1)
length(unique(a)) # count different values in a vector
sleep$extra # access a column of a data frame
```
  

```{r, include=FALSE}
mn <- 7
sec <- 30
delta <- mn + sec/60
tot <- tot + delta
```

`r countdown(minutes = 7, seconds = sec, top = 0)`  

???

estimate $\Delta$ `r delta`, total `r tot` min.

```{r, include=FALSE}
delta <- 7
tot <- tot + delta
```

solution $\Delta$ `r delta`, total `r tot` min.
---

## Code Chunk Options as Variables

````md
`r ''````{r}
# echoornot can be TRUE or FALSE
echoornot <- `TRUE`
```
````


````md
`r ''````{r, echo=`echoornot` ...}
message("will I be there?")
```
````

* The source code of this chunk does
  - show up, **if** `echoornot` is set to TRUE
  - **otherwise** it will not show up in the output document.
* You can insert anything that can be evaluated to TRUE or FALSE:
  - **`echo=Sys.Date() == "2021-05-28"`** (show that chunk only today)
  - **`eval=1>7`** (never evaluate)
  - **`message=!knitr::is_html_output()`** (Don't show messages in [`HTML` output](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/multi-formats.html))


---
class: action

## Exercise

* Open document `r rmd1`.
* Add another code chunk above the two existing ones.
* Define a variable there
  - It is supposed to take the two values `TRUE` or `FALSE`.
  - What value you actually give it, is arbitrary
* Add the options `echo` and `eval` in a way, that always
  - exactly one chunk is "echoed", but not "evaluated"
  - the other chunk is not "echoed", but "evaluated"


```{r, include=FALSE}
mn <- 7
sec <- 30
delta <- mn + sec/60
tot <- tot + delta
```

`r countdown(minutes = 7, seconds = sec, top = 0)`  

???

estimate $\Delta$ `r delta`, total `r tot` min.

```{r, include=FALSE}
delta <- 7
tot <- tot + delta
```

solution $\Delta$ `r delta`, total `r tot` min.
---
## More flexible, but static Figures &mdash; Images &mdash; `knitr`

The `knitr` package offers a capable alternative to markdown syntax with the `include_graphics()` function

- this goes inside code chunks
    - use the function with the double-colon operator <span style="background-color: #ffff88">::</span>     
        - e.g., `knitr::include_graphics("figure.extension")`    
<br>
- this is more customisable, through the use of code chunks
    - size is defined with the **`out.width`** or **`out.hight`** options
        - rather than `fig.height` and/or `fig.width`

???

That had to be moved back here to the dynamic part because it involves code chunks. But it is now a bit strange here. Maybe we can skip this with a short mentioning.

---
## Figures &mdash; Images &mdash; `knitr`

The `knitr` package offers a capable alternative with the `include_graphics()` function

````md
`r ''````{r, screenshot, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The CRC logo."}
knitr::include_graphics("image/crc1412.png")
```
````

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="55%"}
knitr::include_graphics("image/crc1412.png")
```

<center>Figure 1: The CRC logo.</center> 

---
## Figures &mdash; Images &mdash; `knitr`

Size is defined with the chunk options `out.width` or `out.hight` 

````md
`r ''````{r ... `out.width="40%"`}
knitr::include_graphics("image/crc1412.png")
```
````

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="40%"}
knitr::include_graphics("image/crc1412.png")
```

<center>Figure 1: The CRC logo.</center> 

---
## Figures &mdash; Images &mdash; `knitr`

Most other chunk options are common with figures plotted within R Markdown, such as `fig.align`


````md
`r ''````{r ... `fig.align="center"`}
knitr::include_graphics("image/crc1412.png")
```
````

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="40%"}
knitr::include_graphics("image/crc1412.png")
```

<center>Figure 1: The CRC logo.</center>

## Exercise

We skip this. It's similar to what we did before. Dynamic images are much more interesting.

`r countdown(minutes = 0, seconds = 00, top = 0)`

## Dynamic Figures with `ggplot2` &mdash; Overview

- `ggplot2` is a very, very powerful package for visualising data.

- Used widely, not only by academics, but also by large corporations such as the New York Times

- A huge amount is written on this package. See, for example, 

    - the [package documentation](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ggplot2/versions/3.2.1)
    - this [book](https://ggplot2-book.org/) by its creator Hadley Wickham
    - this [reference page](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/)
    - this [webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h29g21z0a68) by one of its authors, Thomas Lin Pedersen  
    - these [extensions](https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), maintained by the `ggplot2` community

- Among its alternatives are the `base` and `plotly` `r cp("plotly")` packages
- We are not talking about R here so `ggplot` will not be covered explicitely.

???

We will skip the ggplot slides.

They are there

## Code Chunks with Figures

.pull-left-c[

Whenever a code chunk contains code producing a figure, the figure is rendered in the output document.

````md
`r ''````{r ... }
(ggplot(durationsGe, aes(Frequency, 
                         DurationOfPrefix))+
   geom_point()+
   scale_x_log10()+
   scale_y_log10()+
   geom_smooth(method=lm)+
   theme_bw() -> `gg1`) ## save plot in variable
```
````

```{r fig1, eval=F, include=F}
(ggplot(durationsGe, aes(Frequency, 
                         DurationOfPrefix))+
   geom_point()+
   scale_x_log10()+
   scale_y_log10()+
   geom_smooth(method=lm)+
   theme_bw() -> gg1) ## save plot in variable
```

**Remark**: Usually you will set the chunk to **`echo=FALSE`**. You don't want to have the figure producing code in your output document.

]

.pull-right-c[

```{r fig1a, echo=F, ref.label="fig1"}
```

]

???

We have saved the plot!

---
## Code Chunks with Figures &mdash; Useful Options

Define the .yellow-h[actual dimensions] of figures, in inches

````md
`r ''````{r ... `fig.height=2`, `fig.width=8`}
gg1 # we saved the plot we saw earlier under this name
```
````

```{r, fig.height=2, fig.width=8, echo=F}
gg1
```

--

````md
`r ''````{r ... `fig.height=10`, `fig.width=2`}
gg1 # still the same variable
```
````

```{r, fig.height=10, fig.width=2, echo=F}
gg1
```



---
## Code Chunks with Figures &mdash; Useful Options

Define the size of figures .yellow-h[as they appear in the output document], with `out.width` and/or `out.height`

````md
`r ''````{r ... `out.width="33%"`}
gg1 # again, the same variable.
```
````

```{r, out.width="33%", echo=F}
gg1
```


---
## Code Chunks with Figures &mdash; Useful Options

Define the alignment of figures &mdash; `left`, `right`, or `center`

````md
`r ''````{r ... `fig.align="center"`}
gg1
```
````

```{r, out.width="33%", echo=F, fig.align="center"}
gg1
```

---
## Code Chunks with Figures &mdash; Other Useful Options

.pull-left-c[

Define captions for figures

````md
`r ''````{r ... `fig.caption="Our Dutch Data"`}
gg1
```
````

```{r, out.width="50%", echo=F, fig.align="center", fig.caption="Our Dutch Data"}
gg1
```
.center[Our Dutch Data] <!-- not in xaringan -->
]

.pull-right-c[
**Remark**: 
* If the caption is shown and if the figure is prefixed by "Figure" and if it is numbered, all depends on the output format.
* In `pdf_document` the `YAML` option **`number_sections: true`** activates figure numbering as well.
]

---
## Code Chunks with Figures &mdash; Other Useful Options

Set the resolution for figures (we choose a ridiculously low one for sake of demponstration)

````md
`r ''````{r ... `dpi=20`}
gg1
```
````

```{r, out.width="30%", echo=F, fig.align="center", dpi=20}
gg1
```

## Figures &mdash; `ggplot2` &mdash; Basics

1) The `ggplot` function and the `data` argument
- specify a data frame in the main `ggplot` function

```{r, eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
ggplot(data = df)
```

--

2) The mapping aesthetics, or .yellow-h[aes]; most importantly, the variable(s) that we want to plot
- specify as an additional argument in the same `ggplot` function

```{r, eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
ggplot(data = df, `mapping = aes(x = h5_median, y = h5_index, color = subfield)`)
```

--

3) The geometric objects, or .yellow-h[geom]; the visual representations

## Figures &mdash; `ggplot2` &mdash; Notes

`geom_point` is one of many geoms avilable
- see this <https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference> for other options, including
    - `geom_bar` for bar charts
    - `geom_boxplot` for box and whiskers plots

---
class: action

## Exercise

Update your `Rmd` file so the output matches `r doc9`.

Add the figure.

The code for it would be

```{r blubber, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(durationsGe,
       aes(Frequency, DurationOfPrefix))+
  geom_point()+
  scale_x_log10()+
  scale_y_log10()+
  geom_smooth(method=lm)+
  theme_bw()
```

Adapt the code chunk options until it looks about right.

```{r, include=FALSE}
mn <- 7
sec <- 30
delta <- mn + sec/60
tot <- tot + delta
```

`r countdown(minutes = 7, seconds = sec, top = 0)`  

???

estimate $\Delta$ `r delta`, total `r tot` min.

```{r, include=FALSE}
delta <- 7
tot <- tot + delta
```

solution $\Delta$ `r delta`, total `r tot` min.

--

.pull-left-c[
````md
`r ''````{r goodfig, fig.cap = "Our beautiful data."}
ggplot(durationsGe, 
       aes(Frequency, 
           nchar(as.character(Word))))+
  geom_jitter()+scale_x_log10()
```
````
]

--

.pull-right-c[
```{r, echo=F}

       aes(Frequency, 
           nchar(as.character(Word))))+
  geom_jitter()+
  scale_x_log10()+
  scale_y_continuous("Length")
```

.inline-c[`Figure \@ref(fig:goodfig) shows that there are no long high frequency words. For lower frequency words there is no visible correlation.`]

would render as

.out-t[Figure 7 shows that there are no long high frequency words. For lower frequency words there is no visible correlation.]

## Requirements for cross references

That's wonderful, but it does not work in base `rmarkdown`.

> To use cross-references, you will need:
* A bookdown output format: Cross-referencing is not provided directly within the base `rmarkdown` package, but is provided as an extension in bookdown `r cp("bookdown")`. We must therefore use an output format from bookdown (e.g., `html_document2`, `pdf_document2`, and `word_document2`, etc.) in the YAML output field.
* A caption to your figure (or table): Figures without a caption will be included directly as images and will therefore not be a numbered figure.
* A labeled code chunk: This provides the identifier for referencing the figure generated by the chunk.  
[--- Yihui Xie](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/cross-ref.html)

That is, the `YAML` output field has to get **`bookdown::pdf_document2`** or the like.

---
class: action

## Exercise

Update your `Rmd` file so the output matches `r doc10`.

Make the reference to Figure 1 a dynamic cross reference:
* Change the `output` variable.
* Name the chunk.
* Create the reference.


```{r, include=FALSE}
mn <- 7
sec <- 30
delta <- mn + sec/60
tot <- tot + delta
```

`r countdown(minutes = 7, seconds = sec, top = 0)`  

???

estimate $\Delta$ `r delta`, total `r tot` min.

```{r, include=FALSE}
delta <- 7
tot <- tot + delta
```

solution $\Delta$ `r delta`, total `r tot` min.

## Dynamic Tables with `stargazer` `r cp("stargazer")` &mdash; Overview

- A capable package for creating tables to present

    - data in columns and rows
    - descriptive/summary statistics
    - regression models

- Used widely by academics
    - Alternatives notably include the `kableExtra` package `r cp("kableExtra")`.

- Creates $\LaTeX$ code, HTML/CSS code, and ASCII text to be knitted

- A lot is written on this package. See, for example, 

    - the [package documentation](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stargazer/versions/5.2.2)
    - this [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stargazer/vignettes/stargazer.pdf) by its author Marek Hlavac
    - this [tutorial](https://www.jakeruss.com/cheatsheets/stargazer/) by Jake Russ



---
## Tables &mdash; `stargazer` &mdash; Notes

- We must

  - set the chunk option .inline-c[results="asis"] for chunks with stargazer tables  
<br>
  - change the argument `type` in the `stargazer()` function for different output formats accordingly   
  <ul> <li style="margin-top: 7px;">e.g., the default <span style="background-color: #e5e5e5; border-radius: 3px; padding: 4px; font-family: 'Source Code Pro', 'Lucida Console', Monaco, monospace;">type = "latex"</span> is for LaTeX and PDF, <span style="background-color: #e5e5e5; border-radius: 3px; padding: 4px; font-family: 'Source Code Pro', 'Lucida Console', Monaco, monospace;">type = "html"</span> for HTML</li> </ul>

--

- It is currently not quite possible to `knit` `stargazer` code into tables in Word documents

  - `stargazer` tables will not appear in Word documents automatically    
<br>
  - workarounds available
      - `knit` to HTML as well as Word, copy the tables from HTML to Word
      - `knit` to PDF, open the PDF in Word
          - in Word, follow `File -> Open`

--

- `stargazer` tables might look slightly different in different output formats

  - on the following slides, they will have the HTML look

---
## Tables &mdash; `stargazer` &mdash; Basics

- The `stargazer()` function

    - this is probably the only fuction you will ever use from this package
        - but it accepts many, many arguments to customise tables

--

- The `data` argument of that function, with two main options

    1. a data frame for data or summary statistics tables
        - e.g., `df`, here coming from <span style="background-color: #e5e5e5; border-radius: 3px; padding: 4px; font-family: 'Source Code Pro', 'Lucida Console', Monaco, monospace;">df <- read_csv(journals.csv)</span>     
<br>
    2. one or more regression models for regression tables
        - e.g., `lm1`, here coming from <span style="background-color: #e5e5e5; border-radius: 3px; padding: 4px; font-family: 'Source Code Pro', 'Lucida Console', Monaco, monospace;">lm1 <- lm(h5_index ~ issues, data = df)</span> 
    
---
## Tables &mdash; `stargazer` &mdash; Data Tables

Table the first four rows of the dataset

````md
`r ''````{r, data_table, `echo=FALSE`, `results="asis"`}

stargazer(data = head(df, n = 4), `type = "latex"`, `summary = FALSE`)

```
````
--

Notice the options of the chunk and the arguments of the function

- with .inline-c[echo=FALSE], the code will not be displayed in the output document

--

- with .inline-c[results="asis"], `knitr` will pass through results without reformatting them 
    - these results are produced in $\LaTeX$, due to <span style="background-color: #e5e5e5; border-radius: 3px; padding: 4px; font-family: 'Source Code Pro', 'Lucida Console', Monaco, monospace;">type = "latex"</span>
    - they should remain $\LaTeX$ because our outcome document is PDF, converted from $\LaTeX$
    
--

- with .inline-c[summary = FALSE], the table will present the data, not its descriptive statistics

## Functionality Gaps

- Not everything is possible to achieve with R Markdown syntax, code chunks, and/or code
    - e.g., centering text

--

- Workarounds available through inclusion of other languages and/or syntaxes in .Rmd documents

    - e.g., incorporating HTML or $\LaTeX$ code into R Markdown
    - workarounds might be output specific
       - e.g., $\LaTeX$-based workarounds may work only for $\LaTeX$ and PDF outputs

--

- There are no exclusive list of gaps or workarounds

    - these are specific to the output you want to achieve, problems you encounter
    - after writing a few manuscripts with R Markdown, you will have addressed most typical gaps in your workflow

How can we cross-reference figures, tables, and equations in R Markdown?

## Functionality Gaps &mdash; Examples &mdash; Cross-references &mdash; Note

Note that there is a difference in the label syntax for figures and R Markdown tables

- we use a double backslash .yellow-h[&#92; &#92;] to label figures

    - e.i., <span style="background-color: #e5e5e5; border-radius: 3px; padding: 4px; font-family: 'Source Code Pro', 'Lucida Console', Monaco, monospace;">\\\label{scatter_plot}</span> because the label goes into a string
    
    - the first is an escape operator for the second, $\LaTeX$ backslash
    
--
   
- we use single backslash .yellow-h[\] to label R Markdown tables

    - e.i., <span style="background-color: #e5e5e5; border-radius: 3px; padding: 4px; font-family: 'Source Code Pro', 'Lucida Console', Monaco, monospace;">\label{handmade_table}</span> because the label is not in any string

---

## Functionality Gaps &mdash; Examples

#### Problem:

R Markdown adds the list of references to the end of documents. This might be undesirable for some manuscripts, for example those with an appendix. Similarly, some journals require tables and figures to be added after references.

--

#### Solution:

Define where exactly the list of references should appear with the HMTL code .inline-c[<div id].inline-c[="refs"></div>]

```{r eval = FALSE}
# References
<div id = "refs"></div>

# Appendix
```

---
## Functionality Gaps &mdash; Examples

#### Problem:

R Markdown produces outputs with single-line-spaced text while we might prefer or be required (e.g., by journal submission rules) to double-space our manuscripts.

#### Solution:

Use the `doublespacing` command from the $\LaTeX$ package `setspace` (Carlisle et al., 2011)
- because the command comes from a package, we need to add it to YAML with `header-includes`
- including commands in YAML ensures they are applied throught the output<sup>*</sup>  

```yaml
---
...
header-includes:
    - \usepackage{setspace}\doublespacing
---
```

.footnote[

<sup>*</sup> This can be reversed anywhere in text, with the `singlespacing` command.

## Exercise

34) Line Spacing
- introduce 1.5 spacing to the manuscript
    - hint: the command is called `onehalfspacing`    
<br>
- except for the Abstract, which should be single spaced

`r countdown(minutes = 2, seconds = 00, top = 0)`

---
## Functionality Gaps &mdash; Examples

#### Problem:

Pages, tables, figures etc. are numbered continuously across an output. We might prefer or be required (e.g., by journal submission rules) to change this behaviour, for example for appendices.

#### Solution:
Use the `setcounter` in combination with the `renewcommand` command, outside code chunks

```{r eval = FALSE}
\setcounter{page}{1}
\renewcommand*{\thepage}{A\arabic{page}}

\setcounter{table}{0}
\renewcommand*{\thetable}{A\arabic{table}}

\setcounter{figure}{0}
\renewcommand*{\thefigure}{A\arabic{figure}}

# Part 8. Using Version Control

.footnote[

[Back to the contents slide](#contents-slide).

]

---
## Version Control

- Research papers have many versions before publication

    - typically written over a long period of time, in numerous sittings
    - at the end of every sitting, essentially a different version of the same manuscript is created<sup>*</sup>

.footnote[

<sup>*</sup> They also often written by multiple authors and/or on different computers, increasing the number of versions created. Here I assume projects are single-authored on a single computer, leaving the topic of collaboration (including, with oneself) to the next section &mdash; Part 9.

]

---
## Version Control

- Research papers have many versions before publication

    - typically written over a long period of time, in numerous sittings
    - at the end of every sitting, essentially a different version of the same manuscript is created
    

- With many versions created over time, there emerge at least two challenges

   - keeping track of changes and versions
   - reverting to a previous version when necessary

--

- We all version control, in different ways, such as

   - edit, rename, save
   - use applications or websites such as Dropbox, Google Docs, Overleaf
   - use distributed version control systems such as Git and GitHub

---
## Version Control &mdash; Manual Attempts

Typically, hand-made attemps to version control lead to cluttered folders

```{r eval=FALSE}
manuscript
   |
   |- journals_FINAL_19May.Rmd
   |- journals_FINAL.Rmd
   |- journals_26APRIL_newliterature.Rmd
   
   ...
   
   |- journals.Rproj
   |- references.bib  
   |- apa_7th.csl
   
```

---
## Version Control &mdash; Git and GitHub &mdash; Definitions

- Git
    - a software that keeps track of versions of a set of files
    - it is *local* to you, the records are kept on your computer

--

- GitHub
    - a hosting service, or a website, that can keep the records
    - it is *remote* to you, like the Dropbox website
    - but unlike Dropbox, GitHub is specifically structured to keep records with Git

--

- Repository, or repo
    - a set of files whose records are kept together, by Git and/or on GitHub
    - it is like a folder, which can keep files and other folders containing files

---
## Version Control &mdash; Git and GitHub &mdash; Definitions

- To commit
    - to take a snaphot of, or to version, a repository
    - it is like saving a new version of all files and sub-folders in your project folder with a new name
    - it is local, the records are kept on your computer unless you `push`

--

- To push
    - to move the records from Git to GitHub, from your computer to online server
    - it is like uploading (the new versions of) your files and sub-folders to a website, 
    - it also involves merging, if this not the first push

.footnote[

<sup>*</sup> For projects that are single-authored on a single computer, merging is typically automatic. It becomes an issue for collaborated projects, which we will cover in the next section &mdash; Part 9.

]

---
## Version Control &mdash; Git and GitHub

Version control with Git and GitHub requires

1. .yellow-h[initial setup], done once<sup>*</sup>
    - unless for a new computer or, if ever, a new GitHub account
    - a bit technical, but worth the hassle
    
2. .yellow-h[project setup], repeated for every paper
    - shorter, less complicated

.footnote[

<sup>*</sup> We have started this process already, in Part 1 of the workshop, by downloading and installing Git and signing up for GitHub. [Back to the relevant slide](#install-git).

1) Initiate local version control with Git

- from the RStudio menu, follow:

> `Tools -> Version Control -> Project Setup... -> Version Control System -> Git`


- after confirming your new repository, and restarting the session, observe that 

   - now there is now a Git tab in RStudio, documenting the differences between you local repository and the one on GitHub. When you change a file, it will appear here.  
   
   - your project now includes a `.gitignore` file
       - this is where you can list files and/or folders to be excluded from being tracked

- observe that

    - repository URLs have the following structure: https://github.com/USER_NAME/REPOSITORY_NAME
    
        - this is the address to view the repository online
        - for use in the `Terminal`, the address gets the `.git` extension

## Version Control &mdash; Git and Github &mdash; Workflow

1) Edit and Save 

- work on one or more files under version control
    - e.g., delete the first sentence of the abstract in `journals.Rmd`, and save it
    - under the Git tab in RStudio, find the list of files that you edited since the last push
    - these will have `M`, for modified, as `Status`     

--

2) Commit and Push

- tick `Staged`<sup>*</sup>  for one or more files that you would like to commit
   - enter a `Commit message` that summarises the edits
   - click `Commit` to create a record of the new version locally to your computer
   - click `Close -> Push` to push the version to GitHub

---
## Version Control &mdash; Git and Github &mdash; `.gitignore`

- `.gitignore` specifies which file(s) and/or folder(s) should be excluded from version control

    - a set of project-specific files are ignored by default
        - see your `.gitignore` file

--

- `.gitignore` lists one item per line

    - each line has a pattern, which determines whether one or more files or folders are to be ignored

--

- See the documentation at <https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore> 

    - for pattern formats and further details

---
## Version Control &mdash; Git and Github &mdash; `.gitignore`

- There might be good reasons to ignore some others, including files

    - that contain information that we do not want others to see
        - e.g., personal API keys    
<br>
    - that we do not have the right to share with others
        - e.g., secondary data with user agreements otherwise    
<br>
    - that we (re-)create automatically as outputs
        - e.g., `journals.pdf`, as opposed to journals.Rmd

## Version Control &mdash; Git and Github &mdash; `.gitignore` &mdash; Notes

- There are many other pattern formats    

    - see the documentation at <https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore>

--

- Starting to ignore a file or folder that is already being tracked requires clearing the cache

    - after changing and saving `.gitignore`, enter the following line in the `Terminal`
    - with your speficic `/path/to/file`

```yaml
git rm --cached /path/to/file

```
--

- The following command clears *all* cache

    - might be useful after changes to `.gitignore` that involves several files or folders
    - but should be used with care, on an otherwise up-to-date repository  
    
```yaml
git rm -r --cached .

```

   - hint: use the `filter` function in the data chunk  
   - create a new version of the manuscript
   - comit and push to GitHub
   
36) Gitignore

# Part 9. Collaborating with Others

.footnote[

[Back to the contents slide](#contents-slide).

]

---
## Collaboration

- Many research papers are written by multiple authors and/or on multiple computers

    - yourself on a different computer (e.g., laptop at home, desktop at office), poses similar challenges as collaboration
    
--

- With multiple authors and/or computers, there emerges at least two additional challenges beyond version control

   - communicating the versions to other authors and/or computers
   - working on the same project with co-authors at the same time

--

- We all manage collaboration, in different ways, such as

   - edit, rename, save, e-mail
   - use applications or websites such as Dropbox, Google Docs, Overleaf
   - use distributed version control systems such as Git and GitHub
   
---
## Collaboration &mdash; Git and GitHub &mdash; Definitions

- To pull

    - to move the (presumably) up-to-date records from GitHub to your computer
    - it is like downloading a zipped folder of files

--

- To merge

    - to integrate different versions into a single version
        - e.g., the old version on your laptop, with (the changes in) the new version from GitHub
    - except the first push or pull, pushing and pulling necessiate merging
    
--

- Merge conflict

    - emerges when versions to be merged include edits *on the same line of the same file*
        - edits on different lines are not a problem as changes are tracked line by line    
<br>
    - less likely to occur in one-author-multiple-computer setting 
        - more likely while collaborating with others    
<br>
    - requires human intervention, to decide which edit to keep and which one to discharge

---
## Collaboration &mdash; Git and GitHub &mdash; Definitions

- Branch

    - a line of development in a repository; a copy of the repository, with all its versions, at a given time
    - by default, repositories have one branch, called *master*


- Pull request    

    - a proposal to pull and merge
        - e.g., a proposal from one co-author to another, 
        -e.g., tp merge a branch into master
    - it allows a review of changes on GitHub before merge, to deal with potential merge conflicts
    


---
## Collaboration &mdash; Git and GitHub &mdash; Project Setup

- The setup depends on the users' role, on whether they are
    - the *owner* who creates the GitHub repository, or
    - the *collaborator* who is then added to that repository

--

- Once the project is setup
    - it continues to be associated with the owner's GitHub profile
    - at the same time, it is listed under the collaborator's profile as well
    - both the owner and the collaborator have the same rights, unless otherwise restricted

---
## Collaboration &mdash; Git and GitHub &mdash; Project Setup &mdash; Owner

1) The setup for the owner is largely the same as in any single-author, single-computer scenario
- following the instructions on [this slide](#rstudio-project) forward
    - to introduce version control to a local project with Git,
    - to create a remote repository for that project on GitHub, and
    - to associate the local project with the remote repository

<br>
--

2) As an additional step, the owner needs to invite their collaborator(s) to the project
- following, from the relevant GitHub repository, 

> `Settings -> Manage access -> Invite a collaborator`


---
## Collaboration &mdash; Git and GitHub &mdash; Project Setup &mdash; Collaborator


1) Notice that the remote part of the setup is done by the owner for the collaborator
- subject to acceptance of the invitation
    - invitations are available directly at <https://github.com/notifications>, but also sent via email
    - with an option to "Accept invitation"
    - on acceptance, projects appear among the repositories of the collaborator
        
--

2) The local part of the setup still needs to be done
- by creating a new RStudio project with version control
- following, from the Rstudio menu,<sup>*</sup> 

> `File -> New Project -> Version Control -> Git`

--

- the `Repository URL`, required for the above process, is the version without the `.git` extension
    - in the form of https://github.com/OWNER_USER_NAME/REPOSITORY_NAME

## Exercises

37) Owner Setup
- create a new version-controlled RStudio project, with Git and GitHub
- add the default R Markdown template to your project
    - hint: click `File -> New File -> R Markdown -> OK` to create the template
    - another hint: name the project and the template in a way that they are easily distinguishable from your partner's project and template

38) Invitation to Collaborate
- invite the partner in your current group as a collaborator to your new project
    - hint: you will need their username, full name, or email address to do so

39) Collaborator Setup
- accepting the invitation from your partner, do the necessary arrangements so that you can collaborate on your partner's project

## Colloboration &mdash; Git and Github &mdash; Workflow

1) Pull

- on the Git tab in RStudio, click `Pull` to move the up-to-date records from GitHub to your computer
    - if your collaborator has not pushed anything since your last pull, you will be noticed that `Already up-to-date`.
    - collaborative projects require pulling as well as pushing because your collaborator(s) might have pushed their commits to GitHub
    - pulling frequently minimises the risk of merge conflicts

--

2) Edit and save; commit and push

- the same procedure as in any single-author, single-computer scenario
    - as described on [this slide](#git-github-basic-workflow) forward
- pushing frequently minimises the risk of merge conflicts

## Exercise

40) Non-simultaneous Collaboration

- take in turns with your partner to work on the same document (of the same project)
    - *owner*: edit the first header in the document (i.e., "R Markdown"), save, commit, and push
    - *owner and collaborator*: observe the changes, if any, on your own `.Rmd` file, and/or on your GitHub repository
        - click on the relevant commit message on GitHub and observe the commit
    - *collaborator*: pull, revert the header back to original, save, commit, and push

`r countdown(minutes = 5, seconds = 00, top = 0)`

--

- notice that you have not encountered any errors and/or merge conflicts
    - because everyone edited and merged with an up-to-date document
    - this is the default scenario in single-author, multiple computer scenario

class: action

## Exercise

41) Simultaneous Collaboration &mdash; Different Lines

- work on the same document at the same time
    - *owner*: edit the first header in the document (i.e., "R Markdown"), save, commit, and push
    - *collaborator*: edit the second header in the document (i.e., "Including Plots"), save, commit, and push
        - observe the error message that the last pusher will receive, follow the instructions on RStudio to solve the problem

`r countdown(minutes = 10, seconds = 00, top = 0)`

--

- notice that you have encountered an error but not a merge conflict
    - pulling before pushing solves the problem because the edits are not on the same line
    - the merge takes place automatically, on the *local* repository of the last pusher

---
class: action

## Exercise

42) Simultaneous Collaboration &mdash; Same Line

- work on the same document at the same time
    - *owner*: edit the first header in the document again, save, commit, and push
    - *collaborator*: edit the first header in the document as well, save, commit, and push
        - observe the error message that the last pusher will receive, follow the instructions on RStudio to solve the problem

`r countdown(minutes = 10, seconds = 00, top = 0)`

--

- notice that you have encountered not only an error but also a merge conflict
    - pulling before pushing alone does not solve the problem because the edits are on the same line
        - the conflict cannot be solved automatically &mdash; it needs human intervention
        - by pulling first, you can view the conflict directly on the file
            - marked between less than <span style="background-color: #ffff88;">&lt;</span> and greater than <span style="background-color: #ffff88;">&gt;</span> signs, divided by the equal signs
            - solution is to accept the remote version, by deleting your edit and or moving that edit to a different line
    - merging takes place on the *local* repository of the last pusher

## Colloboration &mdash; Git and Github &mdash; Workflow &mdash; Alternative

- The workflow above is rather simple, but has some disadvantages, including
    - not easy, albeit still possible, to see the edits of the collaborators
    - not clear who is in charge of the overall progress
    - not possible to discuss edits
    - not possible to compromise on conflicting edits

--

- An alternative workflow exits
    - work on different branches of the same project
    - version control to your own branch
    - create pull requests with comments
    - merge the branch into master


---
## Colloboration &mdash; Git and Github &mdash; Workflow &mdash; Alternative

1) Branch

- click `New Branch` on the Git tab
    - name it, and leave everything else as default
    - notice that you are now working on a new branch


2) Edit and save; commit and push

- the same procedure as in any single-author, single-computer scenario
    - as described on [this slide](#git-github-basic-workflow) forward
- notice, on GitHub, that your commit is in the new branch, while *master* remains unchanged

3) Pull request

- On GitHub, click 
> `Pull requests -> New pull request`

- choose what is to be pulled, and write a note to your collaborator who can accept or reject the merge
    - if there are merge conflicts, the collaborator solves them on GitHub before merging

## Exercises

43) Pull request

- create a pull request for your collaboration project
    - create a branch for yourself
    - edit any line, save, commit, and push
    - request your branch to be merged
    
44) Merging

- view the pull request of your collaborator
- take the necessary steps to merge it to *master*

`r countdown(minutes = 10, seconds = 00, top = 0)`

## Colloboration &mdash; Git and Github &mdash; Workflow &mdash; Notes

- It is possible to edit `.Rmd` documents directly on GitHub

    - click on any editable file, and `Edit this file`
    - commit changes, either as a direct commit or a pull request
--

- A GitHub account is enough for collaboration with co-authors who do not work with Git, R, or RStudio

    - not possible to knit to see the outcome
    - would suit co-authors whose contributions are plain text

---
class: action

## Exercises

45) GitHub edit

- create two edits on the `.Rmd` document in your collaboration project
- commit one of the edits as a direct commit
- commit the other as a pull request

`r countdown(minutes = 5, seconds = 00, top = 0)`

# Part 10. Working on a Real Project

.footnote[

[Back to the contents slide](#contents-slide).

---
## Real Project

- Consider converting a real project to R Markdown
    - now, in the remainder of the workshop

- Choose an existing project, preferably
    - single-authored
    - at an early stage
    - but one that you are, will be, working on

- Ask me for help
    - with no more slides to go through, I will now focus on helping you start your first project in R Markdown
