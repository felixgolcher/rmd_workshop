## Setting up the exercise environment

* The exercises are provided via git: (I prefer https)
  - https://scm.cms.hu-berlin.de/golchefe/rmd_workshop.git
  - git@scm.cms.hu-berlin.de:golchefe/rmd_workshop.git
* The exercises are in numbered directories such as `exercises/03`.
* You work in groups.
* Each group creates its own branch and works exclusively on it.
* But the groups see each other's branches and thus can share and merge code.
* This way we practice collaborating with git as well, which is always a good idea.
* Most of the exercises build on top of each other.
  - you can copy the solutions from `exercises/01` as starting point to `exercises/02` for example.
